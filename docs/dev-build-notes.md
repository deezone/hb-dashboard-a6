- **What is Angular?**
> a JavaScript framework. It is used to build so-called Single Page Applications (SPA)

**Removing AngularJS from your Search**

>You can easily exclude AngularJS search results form your search by using Google's search operators. 
By appending -angularjs to your search term, you only get true angular results.

npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new angular-project
```
